#  Mindful Milestones

## Overview 

 Mindful Milestones is a vision board app that helps  turn goals into actionable steps. Users can save images that inspire, motivate, or represent their dreams and aspirations, and then use them to create a visual representation of their goals. Once the user creates a vision board, they can turn their goals into actionable steps by breaking them down into tasks.
